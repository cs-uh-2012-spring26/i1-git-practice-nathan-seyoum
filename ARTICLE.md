## 🔗 Interesting Article on Software Development

[IBM Think: Software Development](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/software-development)

As a student taking a Software Engineering class, I think this article is interesting because it shows the bigger picture of what software development actually looks like outside of homework and coding assignments. It explains that software development is not just about writing code. It is also about planning, designing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software. That makes a lot of the concepts we are starting to learn feel more meaningful, since you can see how they connect to real world projects and not just classroom exercises.

I also like how it talks about things like Agile, DevOps, and teamwork, because it makes me realize that being a software engineer is just as much about collaboration and problem solving as it is about programming. It helps me understand where I might be heading in future classes, internships, or jobs, and makes SWE feel like a feasible career path.

Amena: I enjoyed reading this article because it clearly breaks down all the key ideas of software engineering, whether its: types of software, who's involved with developing the software, the process, etc.
